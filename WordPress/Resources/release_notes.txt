This version introduces a new block â€“ Jetpack contact info. It's perfect for displaying a nicely formatted address on your site. We've also introduced some spiffy new app icons you can use to customize how the app looks on your home screen. 

We've got some nifty tweaks to tell you about! We've removed the site switcher from the editor to simplify posting, fixed a bug where author names weren't visible, improved VoiceOver support for the columns block, and made it easier to add alt text to an image block.
